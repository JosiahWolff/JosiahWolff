<h1>Hi 👋, my name is Josiah Wolff.</h1>
I'm a driven full stack software engineer and I love seeing a job get done and fixing things! Since I was little I loved building and creating things. I always loved the idea of being able to create whatever you wanted and solving problems along the way, and what better place to do it than on the biggest stage in the world, the internet. Then in middle school, I was introduced to software engineering, and I've always been interested since, and have been open to opportunities to contribute to it.

<h3>🎵SkySongs</h3>

This project uses two different API's, a spotify API, and a weather API. This project finds songs based on the weather to try and match the mood/vibe. There is also a search section where a user can search spotifys library and find songs with their author,album, and the valence of the song. Valence describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). This is how I filtered songs to match the weather.

I would also like to add a back-end to this project so a user can make an account and maybe even link their spotify account to deliver a more personalized experience. It would also give them the ability to save songs to a new section of the website.
